          Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955, the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Woods (1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially-built computer. His paternal grandmother was a Canadian woman from Winnipeg. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management.
          <br><br>
          Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then attended Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.
          <br><br>
          From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics. While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.
